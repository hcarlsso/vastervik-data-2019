execute `unzip_files_run_1.sh` in the same folder as `run_1_zip`. Since KTH box
have size limit of files, I splitted the archive into smaller files. To unzip,
the zip files have to be concatenated before unzipping. Thus, an intermediate
file structure is created to hold the large zip file. So watch the file space
while unzipping. The md5sum check sum can the be used to check that the bag file
is the correct one.
